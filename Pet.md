## First few weeks

### Items

- Adjustable collar and leash
- Collar tags with contact info
- Food and water bowls
- High-quality puppy food
- Poop bags and holder
- Dog bed (for puppy’s first night)
- Toys and treats (start simple, you’ll learn your puppy’s preferences in about a month
- Playpen and baby gates
- Crate
- A ticking clock helps.  It reminds the puppy of her moms heartbeat. Use it only the first few weeks when she cries a lot but then ween her off it. Tabla definitely helps  (*my son plays tabla*).
- My Plan
   - Bed is 45”x35”
   - Equine pine pellets bedding

### First weeks

- *Picking her up*:  When you go to pick up your puppy to bring them home, take an old towel with you, and wipe it on her mom (if available) or her siblings.  Then use that towel for wherever she sleeps.  Wait till she cries at night and then give it to her.  The smell will soothe her nerves.  You can also ask the breeder to wash the mom and use a towel to dry that they can give you. The smell will last longer.
- *Starting Day 1*:  As soon as you get your new puppy home, take them to their “potty spot.” When she is done, praise her right away with lots of positive vocalizations and a treat. Try to make sure they go potty outside before you take them indoors.
- After your puppy is inside, plan on potty breaks every one to two hours. Accidents will happen, but you can start your puppy off on the right paw by establishing a schedule right away. Definitely do more frequent right after meals.
- Make sure house is quiet on the first day.  It’s already a shock to him because of change. TV can trigger nervousness. 
- The first day (and first night) with your puppy is a time to teach them that they’re part of the family. But I always immediately start a routine, as well as physical boundaries, to teach them proper in-home behavior.  Everyone in the house should be consistent.
- You can establish boundaries and help your puppy get used to his new home on the very first day by setting up a “puppy zone.”
- It can include her bed, crate, toys, and food and water bowls, all surrounded by a fence or border that keeps him from wandering away while no one’s looking.
- Show your new puppy their home base as soon as they get home, and throw some treats in so they enter it of their own accord. The more fun you can make it, the more likely they are to settle in quietly.  Don’t give too many treats either even if it’s tempting.  
- A trick to prevent excessive barking when someone comes is to from day one knock on the door and then after a few minutes come inside. But do this consistently the first few weeks many times in the day.  I personally like when they bark at the door so I don’t do this.
- *Night time*: Don’t expect sleep the first month.  Some puppies are quicker.  Simba took about six weeks. 
- She will wake you up a few times. Like human babies, puppies wake up throughout the night. 
- Establish a bedtime routine on your first day and stick to it. While the first night may be challenging, a routine will help her understand what’s expected all of you go to sleep.
- Some people like to have the puppy’s crate in their bedroom, others prefer for the puppy to be in their own room from the beginning. The important thing is to establish a specific sleeping place to help your puppy get the routine. You can make it a warm, inviting place with a nice bed and snuggly toy.
- One thing that helps is get one of your tshirts and let it become hers.  Put it in the crate .  She will recognize the smell of you and it will comfort her.
- Also putting her inside playpen when you guys eat meals is important.
- Eventually the playpen will go away but the scent around the crate will stay so she will adapt and want to return to that area more willingly.
- We averaged about 4 beds a year for the first two years because he would chew on them. After that about two beds a year. The Costco ones are the best. And we only bought the ones that fit in the crate the first year. We didn’t use crate after the first year. Just a bed which we called home. So we could just tell him go home and he knew what to do. But call the bed home from day one.

### Shampoo with Coconut Oil

Makes one pint. What you’ll need

- 1 cup Dr. Bronner’s Pure Castile Soap (I love the mild Hemp Almond scent)
- 1 Tablespoon coconut oil
- 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 2-3 drop pure essential oil (optional)

How to make it

1. Add all the ingredients to a plastic bottle, put the lid on and shake, shake, shake! You may want to thin it slightly with a little warm water.
2. When you’re ready to use, shake the bottle again, and lather up.

### Oatmeal Shampoo

You will need:

- 1 cup oatmeal
- 1/2 cup baking soda
- 1 quart warm water

How to:

In a food processor or coffee grinder, grind oatmeal until it’s a flour. Pour it into a bowl, and stir in the baking soda. Add the warm water and stir until well incorporated. When you’re ready to use it, get your dog wet. Lather her (or him) up with the oatmeal shampoo and allow it to sit for 5 minutes if possible. Rinse off, dry it off.

### Standard Shampoo

You’ve got your dish detergent and white vinegar, now all you need is a spray bottle. The mixture process is simple and requires just three steps:

- 2 cups of warm water to the bottle
- ½ cup of white vinegar
- ¼ cup of Lavendar-scented dish detergents



### Dry Shampoo

You will need: 

- ½ cup cornstarch
- ½ cup baking soda
- 3–5 drops of lavender essential oil

How to: 

1. Combine all ingredients into a container with a shaker top (spice or seasoning jars work well).

2. Brush your dog first then shake on the dry shampoo.

3. Rub through your dog’s coat with your hands. 

4. Brush again and then dust off your dog with an old towel.
