# મોશ્રનાં સર્વોત્તમ કારણરૂપ વચનામ્રૂત

Mumbai, Kartik Sud 6 (૧૪?), Tuesday, 1947 

It looks like this Patraank 166  was written to Pujyashri Saubhagyabhai Lallubhai. In ‘Saubhagya pratye’ also, Patrank-166 is the seventh letter written to him. It is  written on Kartak Sud 6, Vikram Samvat 1947. This was around the time Prabhu attained Shuddha Samkit. Prabhu had just come back from Khambhat, He met Ambalalbhai, Lalluji Muni there. Saubhagyabhai was also there.

Prabhu wrote His first letter to Saubhagyabhai and that letter is Patrank-132. In that Prabhu wrote, “Kshanamapi sajjana sangatireka, bhavati bhavarnavatarane nauka.” Even momentary association with the Enlightened One can save you from the ocean of worldly transmigration. In the first letter, Prabhu said that the Sadguru or the Enlightened One only can save you from this worldly ocean. 

In Patrank-166, there is a pearl of beneficial wisdom for liberation. Prabhu wanted to clarify everything to Saubhagyabhai in the beginning only that these were His beliefs, if he felt them right, he should engage in satsang. Prabhu was very clear and He wanted others also to be very clear. He wrote above five points only for the path of liberation and all His discourses or preachings would revolve around those five points. Prabhu gave beneficial wisdom of liberation with a lot of love and Pujyashri Saubhagyabhai comprehended it with a lot of love. He moulded his life according to these five points. He developed purity, he destroyed his false beliefs. He attained samyag darshan because of this letter.  This letter is the essence of all Agams.If you also understand and comprehend these words, you will gain a lot. 

## 

Every sentence, every word of an Enlightened One is filled with infinite scriptures, how can this be? With endorsement from countless Enlightened Ones, I consider the statements below auspicious and the supreme cause of liberation for every single aspirant:

1. Without giving up all kinds of desires for illusory pleasures at sometime or the other, there is no freedom. So understand that the very moment you hear this statement, you should begin the practise of that course of action. 
2. By any means, search for an Enlightened Master. Having found Him, cultivate an attitude of surrender unto Him through body, mind, speech and soul. Follow only His commands in every way, without any doubts. And realise that then alone can there be complete annihilation of all illusory passions. 
3. Through beginningless cycles of birth and death, you have heard the scriptures infinite times, you have pursued knowledge infinite times, you have taken complete renunciation infinite times, you have attained the position of Head of the congregation infinite times. Nevertheless, you have not found the Truth, not heard the Truth, nor had faith in the Truth. And upon your meeting it, hearing it and having faith in it alone will the yearning for liberation resonate from the Soul. 
4. The path to liberation is not outside but within the Soul. The One who has attained the path shall help attain it.
5. The path is contained in two letters and yet, since time immemorial, after putting in so much effort, why has it not been attained? Deliberate upon this.

### TO DO

Without self-realisation, the soul cannot attain happiness. No one can attain happiness without knowing the soul. What are you born for? You are born to fly in the inner skies, you are not born to be dragged along on the ground. You are a bird and not a worm. A worm keeps dragging itself along the ground. You are not a worm to drag yourself with tensions, worries, anxieties, attachments. You have wings, if someone can teach you how to spread open these wings and fly, you will be ready to fly. Why do you get dragged along the ground? Why do you have so many worries, anxieties, attachments, frustrations, aversions, etc.? If you can fly, if you have wings, if you have understood that the purpose of your existence is to fly in the inner skies, why do you live by dragging yourself along the ground? When you drag yourself, you experience so much pain, you get hurt so many times on the way. Why do you want to travel in a bullock cart, when you can travel by plane? Why do you remain against your nature? When you act against your nature or remain against your nature, you feel miserable. If you remain conducive to your nature and behave accordingly, that is happiness. You have the potential to be and act in a manner conducive to your nature. 

Do not die before lighting the lamp of self-realisation, otherwise, you will repent a lot at the time of death. Just answer this in your mind, ‘Do I want darkness or light?’ Answer this question, from wherever you are. Do you only aspire for liberation i.e. light; or do you still want some favourable circumstances in the world as well as self-realisation? You have to be very clear. You are liking darkness, but you show off that you like the light. 

Pujyashri Lalluji Muni attained samyag darshan with the mantra ‘Sahajatmaswaroop Paramguru.’ He followed Prabhu’s ajna wholeheartedly. He effortlessly slipped into witnessing mode and Prabhu gave him the certificate of having attained samyag darshan. Kabirji said, “Sadguru in your life is like a cyclone”. If you are not experiencing a cyclone in your life, that means you have not met a Sadguru. When there is a cyclone, everything is shaken and disrupted. If nothing gets disrupted, it is only a breeze. All the scriptures are like breeze, the Sadguru is a cyclone. Your beliefs, feelings, thoughts, and lifestyle are shaken and transformed completely in the association of the Sadguru. A cyclone means you are not the same. You cannot say, “I changed a little bit”, then you have not experienced a cyclone. You have to transform completely. 

If a flower blossoms in the jungle, it spreads its fragrance for the whole day and withers away by evening. The whole day, if there was no one to experience its fragrance, what is the purpose of such a flower? Its existence was worthless. In the same way, if you do not attain the unprecedented, your human birth is worthless.

- *Love everyone, but don't depend upon anyone except Satguru.*
- Emptiness can be filled only with આત્મગ્ણાન



### DON’T DO

What the ignorant one thinks of as happiness, is only less grief. If there is less misery, the ignorant one calls it happiness. If there is more misery, the ignorant one calls it unhappiness or misery. If it goes beyond his tolerance level, he calls it a great amount of misery. There is a difference in degree, but there is no qualitative difference in the happiness and unhappiness of an ignorant person. There is no difference in the category; there is only a difference in degree. If it is to a less degree, an ignorant person calls it happiness. If it is to a greater degree, he calls it misery or unhappiness. If it is to a tremendous degree, he calls it a great amount of misery. What happens with misery is, if you have a new type of misery, it gives rise to a lot of pain. Once you get familiar with that misery or unhappiness, you get used to it. For example, if you fall and injure yourself, in the beginning, it is extremely painful. Later, when you become alright, you feel that something is missing as you are able to do things perfectly! If you are slightly acquainted with sorrow, it becomes your habit and if it continues, you start liking it too. You may not accept this today, but if everyone is insulting you all the time, you start enjoying those insults. This is true in the case of people ignoring you as well. In fact, you start enjoying it and then, you do not want anyone to enter that space.

You have an inner feeling of worthlessness, you feel that you are not good, you have a fear of vacuum, emptiness. When you feel an inner emptiness, when you feel lonely, unworthy, then your mind tends to collect worthless things to fill the void. You retain more and more possessions and even engage in addictions, and have more social relations because you feel unworthy within. Psychologists say that a person who overeats is actually feeling empty and worthless within. When you feel that you have not done anything in life, you want to eat more and more. This emptiness can be filled only with self-realisation. If you try to eat more to show that you are very prosperous, you are actually proving that you are unhappy. You keep buying souvenirs, flower pots etc., from various places that you visit. Pujya Gurudevshri goes to someone’s house and realises that the family is very unhappy when He looks at the number of showpieces they have. A happy person does not need so many things. He is happy even within his four walls and he resides there like a king. Those who feel an inner emptiness will fill their hearts and houses with worthless things. 

You want to give a message to your mind, ‘I have got everything, I am happy.’ But you are actually proving that you are unhappy. You indulge in addictions, harbor possessions and by increasing your relations, you show off to people that there are many who love and respect you. Do not trust anyone except the Sadguru. Do not go on anybody’s words or gestures. Love everyone, but do not depend on anyone. You must have friendliness towards all, but do not trust anyone, otherwise, you will repent, thinking, ‘Pujya Gurudevshri had told me, yet I did not listen.’ You keep running after wealth, reputation, power, etc. You are only running after various numbers. It only shows that you are empty within, you do not have the wealth of good feelings, let alone pure feelings. That is why you keep running after external wealth, status, etc. What will you fill your life with? Fill your life with knowing the soul. Today Pujya Gurudevshri is clarifying the purpose of why you are listening to the satsang before introducing the Patrank. Otherwise, all the effort will be in vain. Once the lamp of self-realisation is lit, you will feel content. Once you feel content, you won’t have any desires, you will experience the end of all your cravings. You won’t have the craving of talking or eating even though you do perform these activities. You will not have any desires left. You will not have attachment towards worldly things.

- સનસાર બનાવાની આદત છોડો, we fill our life with useles things - why?

  - અર્થહીનતા નો અનુભવ = *experiencing worthlessness*
  - અને ખાલીપણુ નુ ભય = *coupled with fear of emptiness* cause the mind to collect things, to fill the emptiness with useless (વ્યર્થ) things such as: પરિગ્ર, વ્યસનો, સંબનદો, getting satisfied = સમરૂધઃ

  - આંકડા ની દોડમાં - ધન, પદ, પ્રતિષ્ટા મા દોડયા કરે છે = shows how empty one is inside.
  - શૂબ ભાવ, શૂધ ભાવ ની અન્તરમાં સામરાજ્ય નથી - *no feeling to make you aware that you are lost* (થોઢુક તો સમરૂધ ભાસે)

### CONCEPTS

There are two states of the soul. 

1. Unaware, where the lamp is not kindled; or has been extinguished. 
2. With awareness, where the lamp is lit or kindled. You are still in the state of unawareness, as the lamp of self-realisation has not been lit so far. This human birth is successful only if self-realisation has been attained. There are 2 categories of those with awareness: 
   1. Those who are practising or learning, i.e. the seeker. He is making an effort to know the true nature of the soul. He is going towards samkit (self-realisation). *He is still unaware, but he is aware of his unawareness.* He still has attachments, aversions, he still commits various sins, but he is aware about his impurities and knows that the other person is not at fault, it is his attachment which has created this problem. His dependency has become less. *His focus is on  himself. His conclusions are right, but he cannot behave accordingly*. He is still practising and He knows that he is being carried away in the fruition of darshan moha (faith delusion).
   2. Those who have attained success, i.e. the Enlightened One. He is established in the true nature of the soul. He has attained samkit

The world looks at the flaws of charitra moha (character delusion). In the Ashram, for example, let’s say someone erred in his conduct under the influence of charitra moha (character delusion) and another person erred in his faith under the influence of darshan moha (faith delusion), you will punish and condemn the person who erred in his conduct. The Guru too has to follow this because one with character delusion has made an evident fault. The one with faith delusion has no evident fault, so even if his mistake is much more than the other, you will feed him and the one with who erred in conduct is thrown out from the Ashram. This is the reason, you do not even pay attention to darshan moha, you pay attention to charitra moha only. It is to draw your attention to this, that the whole of Vachanamrutji is written. Param Krupalu Dev does not tolerate any nonsense. He is very clear that the one who has less faith delusion is a better person, the rest are all bad. If you follow good conduct and are lacking in faith, you are not good and you are a bad person. Since time immemorial, this mistake is being repeated, where you do not work on strengthening your faith, i.e. reducing faith delusion, you only work on bettering your character, your conduct, i.e. reducing character delusion. You give up things, but you do not change your understanding. If your understanding is not right, you won’t go towards samkit. This letter is clearly explaining everything. Totally, there are 3 types of people:

1. Unaware - who lives without awareness
2. Seeker – who has developed discrimination
3. Enlightened – who lives with effortless awareness. 

| Ignorant                                                     | Seeker                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Aim**: The ignorant person is extremely busy in the external. Nothing is planned in his life. All his activities are worthless including dharma. He is like a wooden block in the river that floats as per the flow of the river. He goes according to his moods. At lunch time, he is not hungry. He does not want to get up on time. He is drifted away like a leaf being directed by the wind. | **Aim**: The seeker has a well-planned, disciplined life. He has an aim and he wants to do something worthwhile in the direction of his goal. He keeps checking how close he has come to himself or the soul. He does not want to waste time. You may be allowed to stay in the Ashram for many days, but your lifespan may not allow you to stay for very long. He might take small steps but they are in the right direction. He does not jump like a deer in the wrong direction; he takes small steps like a rabbit in the right direction. |
| **Reactions**: i) He gets affected by situations. ii) He becomes reactive in every situation. iii) He becomes a slave. He does not understand that under the influence of delusion, he becomes like a fan, someone else switches him on and off. Someone makes him smile and someone makes him cry. He is controlled by others. | **Reactions**: i) He does not get very affected by situations. He is always happy. ii) He is responsive and not reactive. iii) He is the master of himself. He decides consciously what he wants to do and what he does not want to do. |
| Definition of happiness and unhappiness: He thinks that the causes of his happiness and unhappiness are external. Blame – Someone else is responsible for his unhappiness. If your happiness and unhappiness are outside, you have to blame someone or the other. He always has the desire for more or the fear of misery. He is always in a state of wanting more or in a state of fear | Definition of happiness and unhappiness: He contemplates on why two people react differently in the same situation. Or, he thinks about why in the same situation, he himself responds differently at two different times. Why does he not want to now eat something that he liked a few moments ago? He realises that others are not responsible, he himself is responsible. When your attachment is less, your responses are different. You love children and want to be with them, and at times, when it comes to the same children, you want some space from them. |
| Dissatisfaction: He does not enjoy what he has, and he keeps getting anxious about things that he does not have. He always wants more and more. He keeps thinking, ‘What will happen if I don’t get this thing tomorrow?’ He purchases an insurance policy, and if he does not get a heart attack, he feels that he wasted his money and remains anxious. Someone had put on a lot of weight, so he consulted a doctor. The doctor asked him to play golf, so the running around would decrease his weight. After a month, he told the doctor, “My worries have increased. If I place the ball very near, I can’t see it because of my huge stomach and if I place it a little far, then I can’t hit it.” Such people can never be happy, even if they have the best possible circumstances. Else celestial beings should always be happy, as their wishes are being fulfilled; but that is not the case, because the more you want the poorer you are. | Satisfaction: Contentment does not come with the attainment of things. When there is lack of desires, you have contentment. When you say, “I do not need it,” this is contentment. If you can say this with inner connection, that shows that you are rich! His inner world is so free, he has nothing else to think, so he thinks about the soul |

> Every sentence, every word of an Enlightened One is filled with infinite scriptures, how can this be?

The Enlightened One has attained self-realisation, the foundation stone of liberation has been laid within. He has attained the essence by churning the ocean of various scriptures. He has destroyed the roots of samsara and is directed towards the Pure Soul. In silence, bhakti, or meditation, every moment, He is going towards liberation.

- અનુભૂતિનો અદ્દભુત મહિમા, જેને અનુભૂતિ તેને, સંસાર મૂળ છેદાય, શ્રુતસમુદ્ર ચૈતન્યરત્ન પ્રાપ્ત.

- પરિણતિ નિજાત્મા તરફ વાળી, ક્ષણે ક્ષણે મુક્તિ તરફ, ક્ષણે ક્ષણે સિધ્દપદ આરાધના
- અલ્પ કાળે મોક્ષ

In Jainism, it is said, “If a samyag drashti (self-realised) bull’s hoof touches faeces, that faeces becomes sacred". It is not well mannered to touch anyone with your leg. A self-realised animal cannot be helpful to anyone, but still that faeces becomes sacred. Even as the leg is the lowliest part, just because the self-realised soul’s energy gets transferred to it, that faeces becomes sacred.

Emphasis on the word **Sadguru**. Sadguru holds your hand and show you the way to liberation. You want to surrender your body, mind, and speech because He is the One who helped you get rid of infinite transmigration, and showed you the path in a short span of time. Such a samyag drashti soul who is benevolent to us is Satguru. This Enlightened One is the incarnation of dharma. If you recognise Him, you have recognised dharma. If you connect your inclinations with Him, you have joined your inclination to dharma. If you have faith in Him, you have attained dharma. The Enlightened One is the ideal as well as the support for the spiritual aspirant. The Enlightened One is like the sky, the sun or the moon, He does not need any support Himself, but for the spiritual aspirant, He is a pillar of support..

The Enlightened One has 8 core virtues. Of them, we will talk about 3. 

1. **Sthitikaran** (stabilisation in religion). He remains firm in times of great hardship or calamity. But His compassion is so much that He stabilises those who are unsteady on the path. If someone feels like giving up on the path of liberation, the Enlightened One stabilises him because of His virtue of sthitikaran.
2. **Prabhavana** (raising importance and prestige of dharma and guiding others to the religious path). For those who have not yet awakened, He does Prabhavna - preaches in a sweet way that the person feels like listening to Him, and following His guidance.
3. **Vatsalya** (affection). He showers love and affection to those who are on the path encouraging them to keep
   moving forward. This is the unconditional compassion. When you are blessed to hear the Enlightened One’s ambrosial words, observe His divine countenance, and be in His presence, your inclinations turn towards liberation. You lean towards your inner self. 

> Speaking of the Enlightened One’s words. Words that have touched His soul and then come out through His mouth. 

These words create an ardent desire for liberation, and give us the strength to put in the right effort. He encourages you to go ‘higher’ from the worldly viewpoint, but deeper within from the spiritual viewpoint. The spiritual aspirant hears about the means to attain liberation and has the impetus for liberation, he has a lot of enthusiasm. He forgets all his miseries and pain because the Satguru’s words emerge, having touched the soul. The words also have a limit.

Satguru has left His impurities on the way. He has tread the path Himself. When you listen to the Enlightened One, you experience enthusiasm and delight. It transforms the aspirant and he experiences a steadiness in his feelings. The same state lasts for a long time – it may be the state of glad acceptance or witnessing or the elation of devotion. One of the major difficulties has been overcome because you have found your Sadguru.

If a married lady wants to cry, and she meets relatives from her parent’s house, she will cry more forcefully. You too had the virtues of kindness, peace, equanimity, forgiveness, the urge for liberation, but the moment you met the Enlightened One, your force, enthusiasm and speed on the path reaches another level.

A devotee prays to the Enlightened One, “*Oh, Prabhu! By Your grace, I have dared to aim to attain Siddhalok (liberation). I started the journey towards Siddhalok because of You. Otherwise, I was trapped in my meritorious and unmeritorious karma. But by listening to You, I want to be in the same state as You. But I am an abode of innumerable faults. I know that I am going to have many hindrances because of my faults. I want to go at the same speed as You, but I am filled with flaws and You do not have any flaws. I know that to cross even this much of the path is also going to be a task for me. Prabhu! Please do not leave me. Be with me. I have established You in my heart forever. Please be with me on the path and remain in my heart even in Siddhalok, otherwise, it will be a disgrace to Your compassion.*”

> Every sentence, every word of an Enlightened One is filled with infinite scriptures: 

Every word and every sentence of the Enlightened One has the essence of all scriptures. If you can understand His words, you have learned all the scriptures. Eg. A person has to catch a flight. If he is sleeping and someone calls him by his name, he will immediately wake up. He woke because of someone’s words. Your soul has the essence of all the scriptures within, and to awaken you, the words of the Enlightened One were instrumental, so those words contain the essence of all the scriptures. This is understandable, but you have not yet experienced that awakening. A word that emerged from one soul reached another soul and both attained the same state. In 1952, Ralaj, the word ‘Sahajatmaswaroop Paramguru’ emerged from Param Krupalu Dev’s soul. Pujyashri Lalluji Muni received it in the right way. Within two years, Pujyashri Lalluji Muni attained samyag darshan in Vaso. Your soul has the potential of attaining omniscience, but without the words of the Enlightened One, you won’t attain it. **The soul has the essence of infinite scriptures - Agam in it**.

> Every sentence, every word of an Enlightened One is filled with infinite scriptures, how can this be? 

In Sanskrit, ‘gam, gachchhati’ means ‘to go.’ When you add ‘Aa’, it becomes Agam which means ‘to come’. Whatever knowledge the Lord has, when that knowledge comes to me,  it is Agam or scriptures. The Sthanakwasi sect believes in 32 Agam, The Derawasi sect believes in 45 Agam and the Digambar sect believes in ‘Dwadashangi’ (12 cannons). How can Prabhu say ‘infinite scriptures? It is all the teachings of all the Tirthankaras since infinite time, thus there would be infinite scriptures. Prabhu has ended this sentence with a question mark. He has not made a statement. He has already established the truth, but by putting a question mark, Prabhu has insisted on contemplation by putting up a question to us.

In Patrank-272, Prabhu wrote to Kunvarjibhai Maganlal, who was the brother of Ugriben, wife of Pujyashri Juthabhai, “*Any behaviour of the Enlightened One is worthy of salutations. When you are in the association of an Enlightened One and if He is behaving in a manner in which one certainly must not behave, at that time, how should a spiritual aspirant understand this?*” 

Prabhu established a thought, then He put a question and insisted on contemplation, this is Prabhu’s unique style of writing. If you do not contemplate and then if you are caught by delusion in faith and infinitely bonding anger, within a moment, you would accrue the bondage of millions of births. To stop you from these, Prabhu is asking you to contemplate. For example, you had a lot of respect for the Enlightened One on 1st December, you loved Him, and on 2nd December, your ego was hurt and so you do not have any respect for Him any more; you will start questioning Him. Your problem is not with the Enlightened One or the scriptures, your problem is with your ego. He said that you only think it over and do not listen to anyone. He has already established the fact, now you just have to think of why He said this. Prabhu is very compassionate, at the same time, He is also very sharp. We are safe in His refuge.

> Every sentence, every word of an Enlightened One is filled with infinite scriptures. 

If we talk about Jineshwar Bhagwan’s divine words, the words of Acharya, and on the other hand the Enlightened One’s words. They are extremely benevolent. But Acharya is at the 6th gunasthanak He has embraced monkhood. So you must read those scriptures first then read one or two letters of the Enlightened One. Is this right?

One may say that Vachanamrutji is the essence of ‘**Acharang Sutra**’, ‘**Suygadang Sutra**’, and ‘**Thanang Sutra**’. We can say that it has the essence of 1000 scriptures. No, it is the essence of infinite scriptures. The birthplace of the Agam is the soul. The birthplace of the Enlightened One’s words is also the soul. The birthplace is the same (soul) for both. While the path of liberation can be propounded by Tirthankar Bhagwan only, who has complete knowledge and a completely dispassionate state. But this path can be explained by the Enlightened One, who has attained self-realisation. The one who has known the soul has known everything. If the soul is awakened, He has known all the scriptures, as the one who knows the soul knows everything. 

When the Enlightened One speaks the word, “Soul”, He immediately gets connected to the soul. When He speaks, His words touch the soul and then come out, those words touch the other soul, and every soul has infinite scriptures within, this way in the words and sentences of the Enlightened One, there are infinite Agam.

In the knowledge of the Enlightened One, the soul is evident. That soul has infinite Agam, so infinite Agam are in the Enlightened One’s words and sentences. You worship the Agam and the scriptures with a lot of enthusiasm, you should have the same feeling of respect and regard for the Enlightened One’s words.

Your transformation depends on your spiritual worthiness. It depends on how much love and high regard you hold for the Enlightened One. When the instrumental cause and your worthiness come together, then you can experience fountains of bliss. Whether the words are spoken by the Acharya Bhagwan or the Enlightened One or the ‘Omkar’ of the Tirthankar, you should respect all three of them as the words of the scriptures only because they have come from the soul and have the power to make you experience the soul.

The Enlightened One is not interested in gaining your respect, but you need to follow His ajna to go ahead on the spiritual path. If you are not keeping well and meet a doctor, if you ask him whether to take antibiotics or not, if he says yes, this ‘yes’ has 20 years of his college studies and 40 years of experience in it. In the same way, if the Enlightened One says ‘yes’, that ‘yes’, encompasses His soul. If you ask a lawyer whether to say something or not in the court and if the lawyer says, “Don’t”, and if you did not say that, you won the case. The lawyer must have contemplated for two hours before saying, “Don’t”. In every sentence of the lawyer, he knows the law. When you take each word of the Enlightened One as an ajna, it becomes the reason for self-realisation. 

Prabhu asked Lalluji Muni to chant the rosary of ‘Sahajatmaswaroop Paramguru’ five times in a day. Prabhuishriji followed it religiously and he attained samyag darshan (self-realisation). This ajna became the main instrumental cause in that. Of course, he had the worthiness. 

> What is the first samkit all about? 

In Patrank-751, Prabhu has said, “Faith in the words of the Enlightened One, an unprecedented passion for His commands, devotion to the Enlightened One along with restraining from self-will, that is called the first samkit. The first samkit is the cause of the second samkit and the second samkit is the cause of the third samkit. All three Samkit have been accepted by the Dispassionate One.” The first samkit is nothing but love, faith, and surrendership. The base for spiritual welfare is the Enlightened One and His words. In every word of the Enlightened One, there is only consciousness and nothing else. This consciousness is the abode of happiness and peace. It has nothing but sweetness. The sweetest grapes also felt ashamed and went back to the forest, when they heard the words of the Enlightened One. They felt that their sweetness was nothing in comparison with Param Krupalu Dev’s words. Even the sugarcane was very proud of its sweetness, but when it heard the words of the Enlightened One, its ego was shattered. It went into the machine and turned into juice.

In Patrank-322, Prabhu has said, “Complete faith in the Enlightened One would certainly lead to liberation.” You should never consider the Enlightened One as secondary in importance. An old lady had a house and outside the house, there was a big mountain. She used to go to church and she read, ‘Faith can move mountains.’ The lady used to get disturbed because of the  lack of wind, light, etc., because of the mountain. So she closed the window which was facing the mountain. She prayed for 3 minutes and then opened the window. The mountain had not moved. She got angry and said, “I knew that it was not going to move.” It was written that faith can move mountains. It was not written that prayers can move them. You need firm faith in the words.

> Every sentence, every word of an Enlightened One is filled with infinite scriptures, how can this be? 

“*With endorsement from countless Enlightened Ones, I consider the statements below auspicious and the supreme cause of liberation for every single aspirant*”. 

1. Prabhu is pledging that whatever He is saying in this letter is beneficial wisdom for liberation.
2. He said that it is endorsed by countless Enlightened Ones. Prabhu gives evidence from two sources in many letters. He gives the proof of His own experience and He also gives evidence from the scriptures. This method is used by Shri Kundkundadev, Upadhyayshri Yashovijayji Maharaj, and Param Krupalu Dev. We can see this method in Prabhu’s Patrank-166, Patrank-172, Patrank-194, Patrank-200, Patrank-211, etc. When Shri Kundkundacharya started writing ‘Samaysaar’ in the ‘Mangalacharan’, “*The knowledge which is there since infinity and the Saints who have perfect knowledge of all the scriptures have preached it, I am following that and telling you this.*”. Prabhu also said in the second stanza of Shri Atmasiddhi Shastra, “*Vicharva atmarthine, bhakhyo atra agopya*” (It is presented here without any reservation, for contemplation by the truth-seekers.) Upadhyayshri Yashovijayji Maharaj has written in Adhyatmasaar the same pledge in the seventh stanza of the first chapter, “*Whatever I am going to say now is from the angle of various scriptures, in keeping with the tradition of scholars (Acharya Haribhadrasuri, etc.), and based on my experience*.”

> “Every sentence, every word of an Enlightened One is filled with infinite scriptures.” This is the first sentence, then why is Prabhu giving us evidence in the second sentence? “With endorsement from countless Enlightened Ones, I consider the statements below auspicious and the supreme cause of liberation for every single aspirant.” 

The second sentence provides evidence for the audience who would not believe the first senten.  He gives evidence of His own experience as well as countless Enlightened Ones from the scriptures. He had so much clarity and purity of the path. He spoke the language of the Agam - scriptures and spoke through His experience. Supreme welfare lies in liberation. These five statements are going to be the reason for liberation - supreme welfare.

That which brings about supreme welfare is auspicious (Mangal). Mangal means Man = miseries, gal= dissolves - that which dissolves misery is mangal. Or Mang - happiness, l (laati) = bringing, that which brings happiness. This letter is auspicious because it is the cause of liberation. It dissolves miseries and brings happiness. With endorsement from countless Enlightened Ones: Countless Enlightened Ones have endorsed these five statements. 

*Why did Prabhu write ‘Countless’ Enlightened Ones?* Why did He not write ‘All’ the Enlightened Ones? Why did He not write ‘One, two or three’? 

The reason is the absolute path of liberation is one in all times. “*Ek hoya trana kaalma, parmarthano pantha, prere te parmarthane, te vyavhar samanta*” (There is only one path of supreme bliss for all times, the practice that leads to that bliss is worth adopting.) All the Enlightened Ones have accepted this absolute path of liberation. There is one more - it is called **vyavharik mokshmarg** (relative path of liberation). And the relative path of liberation changes according to place and time. The absolute path of liberation cannot change. Vachanamrutji is filled with devotion towards the Enlightened One. Samaysaar also encompasses devotion for the Enlightened One. But it is expressed differently. In Shri Kundkundacharya’s times, people were not so rigid and crooked. They believed in the Enlightened One, so He gave the next step of going towards the soul, becoming focused inwardly, and realising the Pure Soul. Nowadays the people are rigid and crooked, they become self-willed due to their materialistic lifestyle or they draw wrong conclusions by interpreting the scriptures as per their own imagination and understanding. When Prabhu was writing these letters or giving satsang, such people were there. To remove their self-will, bhakti of the Enlightened One was emphasised.

In Shri Kundkundacharya’s time, people naturally held great regard for the Enlightened One. They just wanted to know about the Pure Soul, or the teachings of the Enlightened One. Thus the order had to be changed in relation to the time and place. Prabhu explained the path and insisted on love, faith, and surrender towards the Enlightened One. Once you have these things, you can study the scriptures, focus within, and attain self- realisation. If it was the absolute path of liberation, all the Enlightened Ones would have the same opinion. 

> When it comes to vyavhar marg, you have to say ‘several’ or ‘countless’, you cannot say ‘all’ Enlightened Ones.

When Prabhu was there, He first asked us to develop eligibility by calming down the defiling instincts. Then lookout for the Enlightened One and follow His ajna. In a few years, you would see that these steps would change, as without the Enlightened One, people won’t be able to calm down their passions etc. If the same scripture is written after 500 years, it will be written, “Do not do anything else, look out for the Enlightened One. He will help you calm your passions.” The absolute path has never changed. Prabhu was extremely perfect in using every word. Prabhu wants people with minimal worthiness to also start walking on the spiritual path. He has made the path very simple.  The ambrosial words of the Dispassionate Ones are extremely calming and interesting. These words are the best medicine for the disease of transmigration. Once the doctor asks you to cut your finger because of gangrene, you would immediately agree. You have a lot of trust in the doctor. The Enlightened One is removing false beliefs, egotism from you, but you are resisting it. The Enlightened One will make you vomit your false beliefs and egotism, but you should have faith in Him. Your treatment will depend on the faith you have. Only listening to the satsang will not help you. But if you have high regard for your Guru and if your faith and trust increase, that would lead to spiritual welfare. The one who transforms after listening will attain spiritual welfare.

Once Pujya Gurudevshri told someone, “The mistake is made by the modification but the results are endured by the whole substance.” Impurities arise in the modifications, but the pain of transmigration is endured by the soul. This modification lasts for a moment. This happens in worldly dealings too. Someone had neck pain, for which she rested her whole body - she took complete bed rest for 15 days. “With endorsement from countless Enlightened Ones”- these words have been used for the relative path of liberation. We must have great faith and trust in all the statements in this letter.
